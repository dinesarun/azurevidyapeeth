BigData - Deploy and work with Apache Spark + Apache Hadoop cluster with Azure Blob in Windows.

Description:
------------
Data, Cloud and AI are the prominent and booming industry now a days. In this webinar, we will start with a presentation about Data Science and Big Data, then I will deploy Spark + Hadoop cluster with Azure Blob in my Windows machine, proceeded by a quick data processing sample using Apache Spark.

Those who are willing to become Big Data engineers and pursue career as Data scientist, this will be an interesting and useful webinar.

Find more details about this webinar below,
1. Major split-up in a Data science project - "Gather, Clean, Store, Process, Visualize".
2. Tools available in Cloud for the same,
    a. Gather, Clean - Azure Data Factory, Informatica...
	b. Store - Azure Blob, Data Lake, SQL Server...
	c. Process - Azure Databricks, HDInsight...
	d. Visualize - SaaS BI tools like PowerBI cloud, Syncfusion Dashboard Cloud...
3. Deploy Pseudo node Apache Hadoop cluster with Azure Blob as data layer in my Windows machine,
	a. Do configuration changes and start the Hadoop services manually.
	b. Configure cluster's data storage layer as Azure Blob.
    c. Execute Hadoop file system commands that interact with Azure Blob like Creating new file / folder in Azure Blob, Empty Trash, Checking permission levels...
    d. Upload NYC taxi csv data to Azure Blob via Hadoop.
4. Deploy Apache Spark for Processing,
    a. Configure Apache Spark with the Hadoop cluster created.
    b. Process using Spark engine NYC Taxi data that exist in Azure Blob.
	c. Export the result as CSV file.
